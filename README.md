### HandwrittenDigitsFromScratch

A feed-forward neural network for classifying handwritten-digits. 

It doesn't use any machine learning libraries (Keras, Tensorflow, PyTorch...) so that I can learn how the algorithms 
like backpropagation and gradient descend actually work. 

NOTE: It uses sklearn, but it's not for the model: it's for loading the MNIST digits dataset.
